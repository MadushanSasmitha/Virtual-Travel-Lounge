// Profile model extension removed — Core Data generated classes are used at build time.
// This file is intentionally left minimal to avoid duplicate symbol errors with Xcode's
// DerivedSources. If you need to add helper properties or methods for Profile, add them
// here but avoid redefining fetchRequest or @NSManaged properties that are generated.
